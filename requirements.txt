# per https://github.com/PyCQA/pycodestyle/issues/741
# pycodestyle==2.4.0 isn't compatiable with flake8==3.5.0
# and since we value flake8 over pycodestyle we'll
# keep pycodestyle @ 2.3.1 until pycodestyle works with
# flake8==3.5.0 - this decision will result in requires.io
# flagging the repo as having out of date requirements
