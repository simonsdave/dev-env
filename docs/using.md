# Using

* ```dev-env``` was originally designed to support provisioning
  of development environments - [this](provisioning.md) describes the details
* ```dev-env``` includes a script [cut-release.sh](../bin/cut-release.sh)
  which, if you follow the required conventions, can dramatically simplify the process
  of creating releases - take a look at [this](../bin/README.md#cut-releasesh) description for more details
* [testing - *details coming soon*](testing.md)

## What Next

* take a look at [other projects on github](https://github.com/simonsdave)
  for examples of how ```dev-env``` is being used
* see [this FAQ](faq.md)
* as you start to integrate ```dev-env``` into your projects
  some feedback would be great - create [issues](../../../issues) and/or
  send me an e-mail [simonsdave@gmail.com](mailto:simonsdave@gmail.com) - thanks in advance!
