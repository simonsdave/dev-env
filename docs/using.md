# Using

* the primary (aka original) scenario that ```dev-env``` was designed
to support was dev env provisioning - take a look at [this](provisioning.md)
for all the gory details
* ```dev-env``` includes a script ([prep-for-release.sh](../bin/prep-for-release.sh))
which, if you follow the required conventions, can dramatically simplify the process
of creating releases - take a look at [this description for more details](prep-for-release-dot-sh.md)

## What Next

* take a look at [my other projects on github](https://github.com/simonsdave)
for examples of how ```dev-env``` is being used
* as you start to integrate ```dev-env``` into your projects
some feedback would be great - create [issues](../../../issues) and/or
send me an e-mail (```simonsdave@gmail.com```) - thanks in advance!
