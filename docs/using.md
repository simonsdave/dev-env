# Using

* the original scenario that ```dev-env``` was designed
to support was dev env provisioning - [this](provisioning.md)
describes the details
* ```dev-env``` includes a script ([prep-for-release.sh](../bin/prep-for-release.sh))
which, if you follow the required conventions, can dramatically simplify the process
of creating releases - take a look at [this](prep-for-release-dot-sh.md) description for more details
* [testing - *details coming soon*](testing.md)

## What Next

* take a look at [my other projects on github](https://github.com/simonsdave)
for examples of how ```dev-env``` is being used
* as you start to integrate ```dev-env``` into your projects
some feedback would be great - create [issues](../../../issues) and/or
send me an e-mail [simonsdave@gmail.com](mailto:simonsdave@gmail.com) - thanks in advance!
