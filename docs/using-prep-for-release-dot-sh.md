# Using ```prep-for-release.sh```

:TODO: add intro

## Conventions

* have a ```CHANGELOG.md``` in a repo's root directory
* ```CHANGELOG.md``` has a specific format
* for each release a new branch (```release-<version>```) is created
based on the current version of master
* repos may contain things like ```README.md``` with references to
branch specific badges and these branch references need to be
updated prior to cutting a release
