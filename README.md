This repo was originally created as a way to centralize
the code/configuration used to provision development environments.
As time went on it became clear that it would be helpful to
centralize other common development tools and utilities.
This repo now contains tools, scripts and utilities which:

* provision development environments
* automate cutting releases
* simplify integration testing

## What Next
